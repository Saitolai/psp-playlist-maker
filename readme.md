# PSP Playlist Maker

A specialized tool for creating and managing music playlists (.m3u8) specifically for the Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP).

## Description

This application provides a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) to build, read, and update playlists. It ensures your music is formatted correctly for the PSP's legacy software to recognize.

The program is made and tested in Windows 10, and have not been confirmed for other operating system currently.

## 📂 PSP File Setup (Critical!)
For playlists to work on your PSP, you **must** follow the official Sony PlayStation Portable directory structure. Ensure your folders are organized as follows on your Memory Stick:

1. **Music Files:** Place all your audio files in:  
   `[Memory Stick]:\MUSIC\`
2. **Playlist Files:** This application should save your generated playlists to:  
   `[Memory Stick]:\PSP\PLAYLIST\MUSIC\`

Do ensure that your PSP firmware is up to date in order to be able to use the playlist features.

(information regarding to early supported firmware version with playlist is reported around [6.10](https://www.psdevwiki.com/psp/Official_Firmware_(OFW)#6.10))
> **Note:** If the `PLAYLIST` or `MUSIC` subfolders do not exist under the `PSP` directory, you must create them manually.
