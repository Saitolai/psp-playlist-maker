SPOTIFY PLAYLIST EXTRACTOR

To run the code, just use python command "py main.py" to run the python script.
*"py mainv2.py" if you want to use the newer version.

A GUI will appear, and you start selecting songs with the file picker.

Once all changes is done, hit save, and name the playlist, and done!

NOTE: Be sure to add songs within the \MUSIC\ folder directory of the PSP for it to work! 

Update notes:
- Added functionality to load from existing PSP playlist to edit and save a new playlist.

What's new in v2:
- Drag and drop option now available! Just drop your music file to the GUI window, and it will add the song in the playlist!
